# AI-enabled ISO Consultant

## Objective

Create a Quality Management System - QMS (set of Section documents and forms) for a company complying to the requirements of ISO 9001:2015 standard.

## Process

Set of **generic Section documents** complying with ISO 9001 are available with me along with some forms (such as risk register, issues register, etc.). The generic Section documents need to be customized based on the company who require QMS.

The process involves the following steps:

1. Take inputs from clients on their specific process (A input form will be required for each section).
2. Based on the inputs, map it to the Section documents/ISO 9001 requirements to identify what are the missing documents in the process. For example, the company is tracking training in a tool. Then they do not need a training register, but if they are not, a training register will be provided. These gaps will be listed on the page.
3. Based on the process related information in the input form, create a well-crafted process based on the inputs given by the client. There may be multiple processes in a single document.
4. Insert that portion in the generic Section document (Where the process needs to be embedded will be marked in generic Section document in `<>`).
5. Get approval from the client on the generated process/document. This can be done for each process or for the complete document.
6. Total of 10 Section documents + few forms will be generated. Forms will not need any change. Only customer logo can be inserted.
7. No need to worry about formatting. The system will take the unformatted text and put it into the document with the right formatting.

## Example: Competence Section (Clause 7.2)

### Section 1: Questions

1. Do you determine the necessary competence for people doing work under your control that affects quality performance? If yes, how?
2. Do you ensure that these persons are competent on the basis of appropriate education, training, or experience? If yes, how?
3. Where applicable, do you take actions to acquire the necessary competence? If yes, how?
4. Do you evaluate the effectiveness of the actions taken to acquire competence? If yes, how?
5. Do you retain appropriate documented information as evidence of competence? If yes, where is it stored?
6. How do you ensure that persons doing work under your control are aware of their contribution to the effectiveness of the QMS, including the benefits of improved performance?
7. How do you ensure that they are aware of the implications of not conforming with the QMS requirements?

### Section 2: Answers from Client

1. Competence is determined based on job descriptions and role requirements. We look at education and experience during hiring.
2. Yes, we check their CVs and certificates during recruitment. We also do an induction training when they join.
3. If someone needs new skills, we send them for external training or do on-the-job mentoring. Sometimes we hire new people with those skills.
4. Not formally. We usually just ask the manager if the person is doing better after training. We don't have a specific form for this.
5. We keep copies of certificates and CVs in their personnel files in the HR office. Training attendance sheets are in a folder on the shared drive.
6. We tell them about quality during the induction. It's also in the employee handbook.
7. We mention it during induction, basically saying we need to follow procedures to keep customers happy.
